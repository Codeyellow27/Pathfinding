# Pathfinding
Dijkstra and A* Algorithms

Welcome to this pathfinding project.

How to launch this project

This project need external ressource to be able to launch successfuly. You need first Visual Studio 2017 (at least), after you download the sources
, you have in it a compress file call ExternalRessources.rar

Extract all the files and put them on the root of the project, so you will have this structure : 
ExternalRessources and the pathfinding project call TestOpenGL on the same directory

How to use this project

Use this input :

1 : Dijkstra
2 : A*

To make a new path , the project use this sequence , first touch the letter of the node (by instance node A),
the first input will be the start node and the second touch will be the destination node. After the destination is selected,
the pathfinding algorithm will search the path from start to destination node
